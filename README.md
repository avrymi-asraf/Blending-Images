# Image Blending Exercise

Implementation of image blending techniques for seamless transitions and hybrid image creation.

## Required Functions

### Tools
* [ ] Load image to numpy array, `load_image`
* [ ] Save imgae ot disk `save_image`
* [ ] Display images for visual inspection, `display_image`
* [ ] Generate Gaussian Pyramid for an image, `generate_gaussian_pyramid`
* [ ] Generate Laplacian Pyramid for an image, `generate_laplacian_pyramid`


### Task 1: Seamless Image Blending
* [ ] Blend two images using a mask and Laplacian pyramid, `blend_images`
* [ ] Generate a mask for image blending, `generate_blend_mask`
* [ ] Verify and visualize the blending process at intermediate stages, `visualize_blending`

### Task 2: Hybrid Image Creation
* [ ] Create a hybrid image combining low frequencies from one image and high frequencies from another, `create_hybrid_image`
* [ ] Apply frequency-based filtering (low-pass and high-pass), `apply_frequency_filter`
* [ ] Adjust and visualize frequency domain representations, `visualize_frequency_components`
* [ ] Validate hybrid image results for clarity and contrast, `validate_hybrid_image`
